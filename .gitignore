# Ignore any file (or directory) that ends in `.meta`.
# Usually, this package will be installed directly from git, so there's no risk
# of Unity's `*.meta` files making their way back to version control.
#
# However, anyone who clones this repository for local development (and loads
# the package locally in Unity) would otherwise be flooded with metadata files.
