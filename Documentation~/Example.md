Hedron SDK for Unity
====================

Let's imagine that there are good usage instructions here. :) Or at least a link
to a website that contains clear, up-to-date instructions.

The package manager links to this document - not `README.md` - although I'm not
sure why, nor which other files and folders in `Documentation~` are noticed.
